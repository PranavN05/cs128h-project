Project Introduction - Fast Fourier Transform
This project implements the commonly used Fast Fourier Transform, a computationally efficient version of the Discrete Fourier Transform. This Fourier transform turns a function of time or distance into a function of frequency, which describes the most present frequencies in the initial dataset. The DFT does this for discrete datasets. The goal of this project is to read in data from an input file, and output the Fourier transformed data in a new file. We chose this project because we noticed that it makes use of linear algebra, and because it is relevant in many fields and we thought it would be useful to get familiar with it.
